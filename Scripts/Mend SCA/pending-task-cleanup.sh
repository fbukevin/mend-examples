# ******** Description ********
# This script pulls all of open pending tasks for an organization and calls the "closePendingTask" 
# API request for each task to ensure they are all closed.

# This script utilizes the Mend Org UUID to call the API Requests.
# If the new Mend Unified Platform is not in use, then the user can get the Organization UUID for a specific organization by running the following API request:
# ðŸ“š https://docs.mend.io/bundle/mend-api-2-0/page/index.html#tag/Access-Management-Organizations/operation/getUserDomains 

# Prerequisites:
# apt install jq curl
# MEND_USER_KEY - An administrator's userkey
# MEND_ORG_UUID - API Key for organization (optional)
# MEND_URL - e.g. https://saas.mend.io/

# Check if MEND_URL is set in the environment
if [ -z "$MEND_URL" ]; then
  echo "Warning: MEND_URL is not set in the environment."
  echo "Please set it to something similar to 'https://saas.mend.io'"
  exit 1

# Check if WS_APIKEY is set in the environment

# Check if MEND_USER_KEY is set in the environment
if [ -z "$MEND_USER_KEY" ]; then

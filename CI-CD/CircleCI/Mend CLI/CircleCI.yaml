version: 2.1
# Use a package of configuration called an orb.

      ## install node/npm
      # - node/install

      ## - maven install
      # - maven/install:
      #    command: '-DskipTests'
# The mend dep scan should be called AFTER a package manager build step such as "mvn clean install -DskipTests=true" or "npm install --only=prod"
# If you are NOT using a service user, and have multiple organizations, don't forget to scall the scope -s parameter to set the organization
